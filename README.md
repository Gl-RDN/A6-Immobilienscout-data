### **Limitation**:
  Even the immoscout24 is the biggest real state platform in Germany there could be data bias due to incomplete information about each listing or there may be some deviation. We can’t assure that every listing is correct.

## **Key Questions and Objectives**:
  Which areas have the highest rent price in Germany? 
  Which areas have the most listings (available property)? 
  What are the main features of the highest priced listing? 
  In big cities, is there notable price difference between city center and surrounding areas?
